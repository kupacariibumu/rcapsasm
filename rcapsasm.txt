disass: radare2
opcode: 
nemo: 
name: Immediate Addressing
dest: Used in cases where you want to load a constant value into an address.

disass: radare2
opcode: 
nemo: 
name: Register Direct Addressing
dest: Used in cases where you want to move data between two registers.

disass: radare2
opcode: 
nemo: 
name: Register Indirect Addressing
dest: Used in cases where you want to load data from an address stored in a register.

disass: radare2
opcode: 041090e5
nemo: ldr r1, [r0, 4]
name: Register Indirect with Offset
dest: Used in cases where you want to load data from an address stored in a register plus some offset.

disass: radare2
opcode: 0410b0e5
nemo: ldr r1, [r0, 4]!
name: Register Indirect Preincrement
dest: Used in cases where you want to increment a register, then access the address stored in it.
